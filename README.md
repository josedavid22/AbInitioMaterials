This document discusses the foundational concepts of material design using ab initio methods, particularly focusing on the multiscale nature of materials. It emphasizes the importance of understanding electronic and atomic interactions to improve material properties for various applications, such as automotive safety. The course begins with a conceptual overview of quantum mechanics and the mathematical framework needed to comprehend these principles. Subsequent sections address the numerical solution of Schr√∂dinger's equation, transitioning to more complex scenarios with increasing dimensionality and particle interactions. The document culminates in the introduction of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT), which simplifies many-body problems into manageable one-particle issues, making advanced simulations feasible.
